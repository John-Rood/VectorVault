Vector Vault is a cutting-edge, cloud-native and RAG-native vector database solution that revolutionizes AI integration in applications. Our platform seamlessly combines vector databases, similarity search, and AI model interactions into a single, easy-to-use service.

## Key Features

- **RAG-Native Architecture**: Perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation in one line of code.
- **Unparalleled Simplicity**: Implement sophisticated AI features with minimal code.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Use our Python package for backend operations and our JavaScript package for easy front-end integration.
- **Cloud-Engine**: Our service handles vector search, retrieval, and AI model interactions, simplifying your architecture.
- **One-Line Operations**: Save to the cloud vector database and generate RAG responses in one line of code.
- **Developer-Centric**: Focus on your application logic rather than complex AI and front-end integrations.
- **Unlimited Isolated Databases**: Create and access an infinite number of vector databases, ideal for multi-tenant applications.

## Quick Start

Install Vector Vault:
```bash
pip install vector-vault
```

Basic usage:
```python
from vectorvault import Vault

vault = Vault(user='YOUR_EMAIL',
              api_key='YOUR_API_KEY', 
              openai_key='YOUR_OPENAI_KEY',
              vault='NAME_OF_VAULT')

# Add data to your vault
vault.add('some text')
vault.get_vectors()
vault.save()

# Get AI-powered RAG responses
rag_response = vault.get_chat("Your question here", get_context=True)
print(rag_response)
```

## Key Concepts

- **Vaults**: Isolated serverless Vector databases. No limits, inifitely scalable.
- **RAG-Native**: Vector Similarity Search Retrieval Augmented Generation by default - fully customizable with params
- **Cloud Engine**: We process operations and AI references in the Vector Vault cloud, making it easy for you to integrate to the front end and build real applications

## Advanced Features

- **Metadata Management**: Easily add and retrieve metadata for your vector entries.
- **Streaming Responses**: Use `get_chat_stream()` for interactive chat experiences.
- **Custom Prompts and Personalities**: Tailor AI responses to your specific needs.

## Use Cases

- AI-powered customer service chatbots
- Semantic search in large document collections
- Personalized content recommendations
- Intelligent chatbots with access to vast knowledge bases
- Multi-tenant systems needing isolated vector databases

## Why Vector Vault?

- **Simplicity**: Easier to use than traditional vector databases and AI integrations.
- **RAG Optimization**: Built from the ground up for Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows.
- **Customization**: Add specific knowledge to your Vault and tailor AI responses to your needs.
- **Scalability**: Fully serverless platform offering unparalleled scalability.
- **Time and Resource Saving**: Dramatically reduce development time for AI feature integration.
