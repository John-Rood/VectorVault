# Vector Vault: A Foundational Platform for Autonomous AI Agents

![Vector Vault Header](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/646ad2edeaaf682a9bbc36da/297fde6c-f5b4-4076-83bc-81dcfdbffebe/Vector+Vault+Header+5000.jpg)

**Vector Vault is a foundational platform for building, deploying, and operating autonomous AI agents.** While most tools focus on creating chatbots, we're engineering the production-grade infrastructure for **persistent, stateful agents** that execute complex tasks over time‚Äîwith or without human supervision.

This isn't just a better vector database. It's the **execution layer for the agentic future.**

## üöÄ Beyond Chatbots: Welcome to Autonomous AI

The AI industry is rapidly moving from simple request-response systems to **autonomous digital workers.** Vector Vault provides the core infrastructure to build agents that:

- **Persist and adapt** across multiple, asynchronous interactions.
- **Execute complex, multi-step workflows** independently.
- **Maintain state** while scaling in a serverless environment.
- **Learn and evolve** from every interaction.
- **Operate autonomously** for hours, days, or indefinitely.

### Vector Flow: Visual Agent Construction
Build sophisticated AI agents visually at **[app.vectorvault.io/vector-flow](https://app.vectorvault.io/vector-flow)**.

- **Drag-and-drop agent design** with advanced reasoning patterns.
- **Multi-platform AI integration** (OpenAI, Claude, Grok, Groq, Gemini).
- **Python execution** in secure, sandboxed containers (run code inside your flows).
- **API integrations** and external tool access.
- **Real-time deployment** with instant production updates.

### Built on PAR (Persistent Agentic Runtime)
Vector Flow runs on a **Persistent Agentic Runtime**. Compute remains **serverless & stateless**, but each agent‚Äôs state is stored durably in the cloud.  
‚Ä¢ **Continuous state** ‚Äì agents pick up exactly where they left off, no context rebuilding.  
‚Ä¢ **Temporal autonomy** ‚Äì agents respond to events over minutes, hours, or days.  
‚Ä¢ **Scalable execution** ‚Äì state lives in PAR while stateless workers spin up on-demand to process steps.

This architecture is what lets Vector Vault move beyond chatbots and power long-running, auditable AI systems.

## ‚ö° Quick Start: Your First Autonomous Agent

#### Install:
```bash
pip install vector-vault
```

#### Build an Intelligent Agent in Minutes:

```python
from vectorvault import Vault

# Initialize with multi-platform AI support
vault = Vault(
    user='YOUR_EMAIL',
    api_key='YOUR_VECTOR_VAULT_API_KEY', 
    openai_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY',
    anthropic_key='YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY',  # optional
    vault='MY_AGENT_VAULT'
)

# Build your agent's knowledge base
vault.add('Your domain expertise, technical docs, and procedures...')
vault.get_vectors()
vault.save()

# Deploy autonomous workflows
agent_response = vault.run_flow(
    'intelligent_assistant',
    'Process this new customer inquiry',
    customer_data={"tier": "premium", "history": [...]},
    escalation_rules={"urgent": True}
)

# Get context-aware responses with smart history
response = vault.get_chat(
    "What about that issue we discussed earlier?",
    history=conversation_history,
    get_context=True,
    smart_history_search=True,  # AI generates contextual search queries
    model="claude-sonnet-4-0"   # Switch models seamlessly
)
```

## üß† Platform-Agnostic AI Intelligence

Vector Vault supports all leading AI platforms under one interface. Switch between OpenAI, Claude, Grok and Gemini **mid-conversation** without changing your code:

```python
# Start with OpenAI for analysis
response = vault.get_chat("Analyze this data", model="gpt-4o")

# Switch to Claude for reasoning  
response = vault.get_chat("What's your recommendation based on that?", model="claude-sonnet-4-0")

# Use Grok for creative tasks
response = vault.get_chat("Now, generate some innovative solutions", model="grok-4")
```

## üéØ Smart History Search: Context That Actually Works

Traditional RAG fails when users say "Tell me more about that" or "How do I fix that?" Our **Smart History Search** solves this by using AI to generate a contextual search query based on the conversation history.

```python
# User: "I'm getting database timeout errors in PostgreSQL"
# AI: "Here are some common causes..."
# User: "How do I fix that?"

# WITHOUT smart search: Searches "how do I fix that" ‚Üí returns random, generic results
# WITH smart search: Searches "PostgreSQL database timeout errors fix" ‚Üí returns specific solutions

response = vault.get_chat(
    "How do I fix that?",  # Vague, contextual query
    history=conversation_history,
    get_context=True,
    smart_history_search=True
)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Advanced Agent Capabilities

### Multimodal Intelligence
Build agents that can see and understand images and documents.
```python
response = vault.get_chat(
    "Analyze the key takeaways from this financial report",
    image_path="/path/to/report.pdf", 
    get_context=True
)
```

### Real-Time Streaming
Create interactive and responsive agent experiences.
```python
# Console applications
response = vault.print_stream(
    vault.get_chat_stream("Research the latest AI trends", get_context=True)
)

# Web applications (Server-Sent Events)
@app.route('/agent-stream')
def agent_chat():
    return Response(
        vault.cloud_stream(vault.get_chat_stream(user_message, get_context=True)),
        mimetype='text/event-stream'
    )
```
