# Security 
This is a seperate readme on our data handling procedures to keep it seperate from the docs.

### Data Encryption: 
We ensure your data is secured both in transit and at rest with industry-leading encryption standards. This means that your data is encrypted while it is being transferred to the cloud and also when it is stored in the cloud, providing end-to-end security.

### Access Control: 
We employ robust access control mechanisms to ensure your data is accessible only by authorized users. User authentication is facilitated through a secure API that adheres to the principle of minimum required permissions, meaning that a user is granted only the access that is necessary to perform their task.

### Data Privacy: 
Your privacy is our priority. We firmly commit to not share your data with any third parties without your explicit permission, ensuring your data remains under your control.

### Data Backups and Recovery: 
To guard against data loss, we automatically backup your data regularly. In the event of any unforeseen circumstances leading to data loss, we have an automatic disaster recovery mechanism in place. It's important to note that user-deleted data is permanently removed and cannot be recovered as part of our commitment to your data privacy.

### API Security: 
API keys, much like passwords, are stored securely using a hashed storage system, ensuring they cannot be reverse-engineered. In case you lose your API key, you can easily generate a new one using your password. Moreover, if your API key is accidentally exposed to a third party, it can be swiftly disabled, and a new one generated, further enhancing the safety of your data access.
